Result: WordPress user Roles and Capabilities give you the ability to 
control what other users can or cannot do on your site. You can
 use them to manage user actions such as writing and editing posts, 
 creating new pages, moderating comments, installing plugins, adding 
 new users, and much more. ?php  $role = get_role( 'editor' );  $role->add_cap( 'unfiltered_upload' );?>
Weâ€™ll discuss more about how to add or customize capabilities of all the user 
roles or specific users later in this post.
